Hi I'm David McGillicuddy. This is my website. Lorem ipsum and all that. I am not a graphic designer as you may be able to tell.

I'm currently a server-side Scala programmer based in London with strong experience both teaching and practicing functional programming.

My main hobby project at the moment is [a library for coding on an arduino in Rust](https://github.com/djmcgill/to-the-moon).
